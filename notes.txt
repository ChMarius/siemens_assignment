  So, here is a documentation of my thought process, more or less.

  I started by doing research of how to theoretically transform an CSYS1 (global) system into a CSYS2 (local) system. For that I used ChatGPT, to explain to me 
how should I start and what should I calculate and the corresponding formulas for each step. I also used ChatGPT, to dive deeper into research about the NumPy library, too see which function of it should I use.

  By how I see things, I should take more of a methodical approach to this and design the whole program in a more modular way, with separations of concerns in mind, for clean and understandable management 
of code, where each file is a subsystem, for easier understanding of the flowm and debugging.

  One of the first things I should do, into implementation, is to check the orthonormality of the systems. More details about the implementation are in the ortho_functions.txt.

After that, the next step, it to convert the local point into global coordinates using the formula: p_global = O1 + R1*p1
O1 = origin of CSYS1
R1 = rotation matrix
p1 = local point in CSYS1
After getting the global point, we convert it into the CSYS2 system with the formula: p2 = R2^T*(p_global - O2)
R2^T = transpose of the CSYS2 rotation matrix
O2 = origin of CSYS2
These are the two main formulas to get the desired result. The rest of the implementation is orthonormality checks, data validation and the unit test



  For robustness, I also implemented error handling with clear explanations and data validation.
