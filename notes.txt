I've taken notes in my notebook, trying to understand the properties of the coordinates system.

From the example given:
CSYS.Origin = [10.0, 5.0, 3.0]

              [0.99452, 0.10453, 0] -> vector to which the X-axis is pointing
CSYS.Matrix = [-0.10453, 0.99452, 0] -> vector to which the Y-axis is pointing
              [0,          0,     1] -> vector to which the Z-axis is pointing

[x1, y1, z1] = [10, 5, 3] needs to be transformed in [x2, y2, z2]
- Rotated 6 degrees around Z-axis (alpha=6)

alpha = angle by which rotation around Z-axis is done

I've used ChatGPT to find out more details about CSYS coordinate systems and the formula for transforming from a CSYS1 system to a CSYS2 system.
I found out the general formula is:

Vector in CSYS2 = Transpose of Rotation Matrix x Vector in CSYS2

                  [cos(alpha) -sin(alpha) 0]
Rotation Matrix = [sin(alpha) cos(alpha)  0]
                  [0             0        1]

                                   [cos(alpha) sin(alpha)  0]
Transpose of the rotation matrix = [-sin(alpha) cos(alpha) 0]
                                   [0              0       1]
